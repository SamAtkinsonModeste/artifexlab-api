## Project Overview

The **ArtifexLab API** is the backend system behind a vibrant creative platform where users can share digital artwork, engage with community tutorials, and interact through likes, comments, and follows.

Built using **Django REST Framework**, the API handles secure authentication, user profile management, and full CRUD functionality for artworks and tutorials. It also supports custom feedback features and social interactions to encourage learning, growth, and mentorship within the creative community.

Designed to integrate seamlessly with the React-based frontend, this API provides a scalable and structured foundation that empowers creators to connect, inspire, and thrive.

## API Aims

- To provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for:
  - Artworks uploaded by users
  - Tutorials created by mentors
  - User profiles and bios
  - Comments on artworks and tutorials
  - Like and favourite actions
- To enable social interactions through follows, likes, and comments
- To allow mentors to provide feedback on tutorial attempts submitted by users
- To deliver filtered and personalized content (e.g., artwork from followed users, favourited tutorials)
- To support learning and growth through structured tutorial content
- To integrate cleanly with the React-based frontend via RESTful endpoints
